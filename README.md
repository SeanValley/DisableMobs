**DisableMobs**

By: Jakeob22

Recommended Build:

	Version: 2.0 for Bukkit build 1.13.2

[Spigot Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/disablemobs.65441/)

Features:

Allows a bukkit server owner to choose exactly which creatures can spawn and which are blocked from spawning.

Description:

This bukkit plugin will easily allow the server owner to choose which mobs will spawn and which won't. The first time you run it, a configuration file will be generated with the names of all of the minecraft creatures. You can set each creature to true if you want them to spawn, or false if you don't want them to. For example, if Blaze is set to true, blazes will be allowed to spawn. If Blaze is set to false, you won't find any Blazes in your game because they are blocked from spawning. This is the same for every creature on the "Supported Creatures" list. Have fun! ;)
